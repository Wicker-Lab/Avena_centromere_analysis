-------------> TE sequence fasta datasets 

contains:
Consensus sequences in fasta format for the indiviual TE subfmailies described in the paper

TEpop_RLG_Aurora_flat
TEpop_RLG_Ava_flat
TEpop_RLG_Beth_flat
TEpop_RLG_Cereba_flat

These files contain:
Full collection of full-length TE copies identfied with the TEpop pipeline in fasta format
The description line contains:
- Full name of the individual TE copy (contains chromosome name)
- Start and end position on the respective chromosome
- Transcriptional orientation (F/R)
- Sequence of the target site duplication (TSD, usually 5 identical bp flanking the TE, but can contain mismatches)
- Subfamily designation


-------------> Insertion ages TE copies

contains:
The tables including the estimated insertion ages of individual TE copies

TEpop flat files for the indiviual TE copies:

insertion_age_RLG_Aurora
insertion_age_RLG_Ava
insertion_age_RLG_Beth
insertion_age_RLG_Cereba

These files contain: 
- name of the TE copy (TE)
- information on aln of the LTRs (aln, sim)
- Transition and transversion scors (TI, TV)
- estimated insertion age and standard deviations (age, std)
- genome short name (genome_short)
- subgenome (subgenome)
- species / genome (genome)


-------------> Phylogeneitc trees of individual TE copies

contains:
Tree files produced using RAxML with mapped bootstrap support values for the groups described in the paper

Ava_all_map_bootstraps.raxml.support
Ava_G1_map_bootstraps.raxml.support
Ava_G1_1_map_bootstraps.raxml.support
Ava_G2_map_bootstraps.raxml.support
Ava_G3_map_bootstraps.raxml.support


-------------> Protein consensus tree CRM Poaceae

contains:
Data on the protein consensus tree presented in the paper

CRMs_across_Poaceae_cut_flat (includes RT, RH and INT protein domains; cut from aln)
CRMs_across_Poaceae_cut_flat.aln
CRMs_across_Poaceae_cut_flat.tre


-------------> Subset of TREP database + new consensus
contains:
A Poaceae specific subset of the TREP database including newly produced consensus sequences

POA_TEdb_subset_TREP
